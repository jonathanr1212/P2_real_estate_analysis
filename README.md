## Overview
This project analyzes the resource needs of an untitled Microsoft movie company, which wants to jump into the original video content space. Information from the datasets came from movie tracking websites. Descriptive analysis is done to figure what movies should the company make to be successful in the box office.

## Business Problem
A real estate firm wants to help their clients (Homeowners) sell their homes at a great price. The analysis can help show correlations between what drives the value of a home and may advise the homeowner to make the necessary upgrades to get better value for their homes.

## Data Understanding
The data provided was from the King County Sales Dataset. It contained 21597 rows and 20 columns. Each row included different information on different aspects of a home. The target of the data was price and the goal was to see how each aspect of a home impacted the sale price of the home.

## Modeling
The Analysis used linear regression. The model started intially with a simple linear regression and ended up evolving into a multivariable linear regression with 9 features. 

## Regression Results





## Conclusion
This analysis leads to this recommendation on what the real estate company should advise homeowners on when it comes to increasing the value of their home for sale.

<b>Grade is one of the most important factors that can be controlled by the homeowner for price.</b>

A per grade increase of a home (housing construction including quality materials for exterior and interior) can increase the value of a home by 17.7%. Homeowners should modify their homes with higher quality materials for interiors and exteriors structures.

<b>For the interior of homes:</b>

Plumbing, Flooring, Climate control, Electrical are components of a home that can improve grade.

<b>For the exterior of homes:</b>

Exterior walls and Roofing are components of a home that can improve grade.

While quality materials are desirable for a home upgrade, craftsmanship plays an important role in grading. If a home has the highest quality materials but poorly constructed, grade could be negatively affected.

To highlight this, if we were to focus on adding bedrooms and bathrooms instead of upgrades that focus on grade, it could possibly have a negative effect on pricing with a roughly 0.1% and % 0.2% per bed or bath decrease in the value of the home.

Homes could have less bedrooms and bathrooms but yet still hold the same value as a home with more bedrooms or bathrooms.
